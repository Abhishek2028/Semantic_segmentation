# Semantic_segmentation
This repository contains implementations of Semantic image segmentations using fully convolutional neural networks
In every implementation, we use the "Oxford-iit pet dataset".
The notebooks uploaded were run very less number of epochs due to low computational power. If trained for more epochs, they give the required results.
You could download the datsets used using the link https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/
